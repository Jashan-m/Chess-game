### Chess Game with Pygame

This project is a simple chess game implemented using Pygame. It features a graphical interface that displays an 8x8 chessboard and allows two players to make moves according to standard chess rules. The game includes basic functionality for piece movement and turn management.

#### Features
- **Chessboard Rendering:** The game renders an 8x8 chessboard with alternating colors for the squares.
- **Piece Images:** Chess pieces are displayed using images loaded from the `images/` directory. Each piece has a corresponding image file.
- **Piece Movement:** Valid moves are checked based on the type of piece (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King). Movement rules for each piece are implemented, including special moves like pawn promotion and en passant.
- **Turn Management:** The game alternates turns between two players, represented by 'w' for white and 'b' for black.
